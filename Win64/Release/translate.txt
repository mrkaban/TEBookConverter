Thank you for considering translating TEBookConverter to your language. You can do this by following
a few easy steps:

1-Open "TEBookConverter.lng" file with a text editor (file is located next to TEBookConverter.exe)
2-Start translating English texts to your language. Follow these rules:
	2.1-Do not translate sections starting with "[Ts". They are reserved for skinning component
	and translating them may cause problems.
	2.2-Do not translate "XYZ.SkinData.SkinSection" lines. They are reserved for skinning component
	and translating them may cause problems.
	2.3-Do not translate "[TMadExcept]" section.
	2.5-Sections you will be translating will generally have "[TXXXForm]" name (TMainForm for example)
	2.5-Do not change first 8 lines.
3-Respect formated strings. You will see strings like "%d files", "%d" here will be converted to a number
in the run time ("516 files" for example) so adjust your translation according to that.
4-Try to translate strings so that they fit the interface.

Updates:
When I make a change that requires translations to be updated, I will send you an updated version of your language file.
New entries or lines that need updating will be marked with (!). Unused lines will start with (x). After making neccessary 
changes, please remove these symbols.

After you finished translation (or updating), save edited file as "TEBookConverter.xy.lng". "xy" here is language code (tr for Turkish 
for example). Send the file with the following information to ozok26@gmail.com:
1-Language
2-Your name and email address
3-Whether you want to appear in translators list

You can always contact me at ozok26@gmail.com .

Thank you again.
